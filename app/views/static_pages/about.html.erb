        <p>Where's Home is a novel service that allows landlords to prescreen potential tenants, helps renters streamline the process of leasing an apartment, and cuts out the real agent all together. </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>How it Works</b></p><br>
        <p>Renters create an account, answer several questions about their rental preferences and background, then recieve access to listings from landlords who have pre-accepted their qualifications. Once you sign up for the service, simply apply to tour an apartment from your listings. See just how hasslefree Where's Home is compared to the headaches of jumping through hoops for real estate agents and being interrogated by landlords.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Landlords get access to a prescreened group of potential tenants for their properties and bypass the sky high fees applied by real estate agents.
        <hr>
        <p><b>Why its Different (Looking at You Craigslist)</b></p><br>
        <p>First, no real estate agents. Cutting out the middle man makes leasing cheaper for tenants and for landlords. Second, if you're in the market for an apartment, prescreening buyers streamlines the process of finding a home. Third, if you're a landlord, finding a tenant no longer involves endless vetting of potential tenants and you won't be charged hundreds of dollars by a real estate broker.
